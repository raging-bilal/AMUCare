🔐 Secure Payment Integration
For donation processing, you need to integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal). Follow the steps below to set up the keys for your environment:

Add Payment API Keys: In your settings.py, insert your payment gateway credentials. For security purposes, it's recommended to store these keys in environment variables.

Configure Payment Processing: Modify the donate.js file to include payment handling logic for one-time and recurring donations via your chosen gateway.

**🛠️ Deployment**
When deploying to production:

Switch to PostgreSQL as the database.
Set up a secure environment by managing secrets and API keys via environment variables.
Configure the payment gateway keys on the server.
Use Gunicorn or uWSGI for running Django applications in production.
Use a web server like Nginx to serve static files and handle requests.
